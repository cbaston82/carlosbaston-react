            Hello Folks I&rsquo;m <strong>Carlos</strong> and I&rsquo;m a
            Manager of Software Engineering, student of the web and problem
            solver. I have a vast knowledge in frontend and backend technologies
            with a great understanding in building full-stack Software
            applications. I like to do it all; there is no problem to big that I
            won&rsquo;t take on because I enjoy solving problems. I&rsquo;m
            currently residing in Las Vegas, NV where my favorite hobbie outside
            of coding is playing the game of billiards. I&rsquo;m currently open
            for hire or if you just want to network that is great too.
            <br />
